# How does this repository work?

This project was generated using `create-nx-plugin porscheofficial`. All of the following instructions are derived from this generated plugin repository.

## Adding a plugin

To add more plugins to this repository execute:

    nx g @nx/plugin:plugin your-plugin-name

**Note:** It is recommended to use dashes in your plugin name.

Your plugin will have the default namespace (currently `porscheofficial`) for this repository. You can change this in the `package.json` of your plugin.

## Building & Publishing

To build your plugin simply call

    nx build your-plugin-name

This will create the transpiled output in `/dist/packages/your-plugin-name/`

Our plugins are scoped. The scope is the part before the `/` inside your plugin's `package.json`. To publish your plugin somewhere else than npmjs.com, you'll have to create an `.npmrc` file in the project root. (TODO: This file could be added in the future). The file should look like this

    <scope>:registry = https://artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/api/npm/<npm repository name>/

Before you publish:

-   Make sure you're logged in into the repository you're trying to publish to
-   Go to the output directory of your plugin (`dist/packages/your-plugin-name`)
-   Verify the `package.json` looks good (scope is correct, version is up to date, ...)

Finally execute

    yarn publish

and follow the instructions.
